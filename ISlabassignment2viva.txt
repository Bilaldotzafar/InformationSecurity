Key Concepts to Memorize:

gcd() function - Finds the greatest common divisor (checks if a is valid for encryption)
mod_inverse() function - Finds the multiplicative inverse of a modulo 26 (needed for decryption)
encrypt() function - Uses the formula: encrypted = (a * x + b) % 26

Converts each letter to a number (0-25)
Applies the formula
Converts back to a letter


decrypt() function - Uses the formula: decrypted = a_inverse * (y - b) % 26

Finds the inverse of a first
Reverses the encryption process



Important Points for Your Viva:

a value must be coprime with 26 (gcd(a, 26) = 1). Valid values: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25
b value can be any number from 0-25
The code preserves spaces, punctuation, and letter case
Encryption and decryption are inverse operations

Test it: Run with a=5, b=8 and text "Hello" to see it work!
